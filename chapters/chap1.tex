\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	$$g(x) = \int_{0}^{x} t^{1/3}dt = \frac{3}{4}x^4/3$$
	$$g'(x) = x^{1/3}$$
	So, as seen before, $g'$ is $C^0$ but not $C^1$. As such, $g$ is $C^1$, but not $C^2$. And
	$h = \int_{0}^{x} g(t) dt$, which has $h' = g$, is $C^2$ but not $C^3$.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}
\end{problem}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item
	      \begin{proof}
		      Base case: $k = 0$, it is obviously true, with $p_{0} = 1$. Suppose it's true for $k > 1$. Then
		      $$f^{(k)}(x) = p_{2k}(1/x)e^{-1/x} $$

		      \begin{align*}
			      f^{(k+1)}(x) & = (p_{2k}(1/x))' \cdot (e^{-1/x}) + (p_{2k}(1/x))\cdot(e^{-1/x})'                     \\
			                   & = (p_{2k})'(1/x)\frac{1}{x^2}\cdot(e^{-1/x}) + p_{2k}(1/x)\cdot e^{-1/x}\frac{1}{x^2} \\
			                   & =  e^{-1/x} \cdot \frac{(p_{2k})'(1/x) + p_{2k}(1/x)}{x^2}                            \\
		      \end{align*}
		      Now, $(p_{2k})'(1/x)/x^2$ is a polynomial on $(1/x)$ of degree $2k + 1$ and $p_{2k}(1/x)/x^2$ is of degree
		      $2k + 2$, so $(p_{2k})'(1/x)/x^2 + p_{2k}(1/x)/x^2$ is a polynomial on $(1/x)$ of degree $2k + 2$, proving the hypothesis.
	      \end{proof}
	\item \begin{proof}
		      These formula are certainly valid for any $x \neq 0$. For $x \to 0$, it suffices to notice that $e^{-1/x} \lll p_{2k}(1/x)$ for any $k$.
		      So $f^{k}$ is defined for all $\R$ and, (taking the limit) is $0$ at $0$ for any $k$.
	      \end{proof}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}
\end{problem}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item \begin{proof}
		      $\tan$ is $C^\infty$ on $(-\pi/2,\pi/2)$ as, taking derivatives, on the denominators only $\cos$ appears and they never 0
		      on this interval. Its inverse, $\arctan$ has derivative $\frac{1}{1+x^2}$ which
		      also is $C^\infty$.
	      \end{proof}
	\item \begin{proof}
		      Consider
		      $$h(x) = \frac{x - (b+a)/2}{(b-a)/2}$$
	      \end{proof}
	\item \begin{proof}
		      Consider $h(x) = \exp(x) + a$ and $g(x) = b - \exp(x)$, then clearly $h$ and $g$ are diffeomorphisms, and we may compose
		      the inverses to find that by the diffeomorphism $g\circ h^{-1}$, the intervals are diffeomorphic.
	      \end{proof}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
	Consider the smooth inverse
	$$g : \R^n \to \bigg(-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\bigg)^n,\quad g(x_1, \dots, x_n) = (\arctan(x_1), \dots, \arctan(x_n))$$
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}
\end{problem}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item \begin{proof}
		      We parametrize the line between $(0,0,1)$ and $(a,b,c)$ by $t$ and solve for when $z = 0$.
		      $$l(t) = (0,0,1) + t \cdot ((a,b,c) - (0,0,1)) = (ta, tb, 1 + t(c-1))$$
		      $$l_3(t) = 0 \iff 1 + t(c-1) = 0 \iff t = \frac{1}{1-c}$$
		      yielding precisely
		      $$g(a,b,c) = \bigg( \frac{a}{1-c}, \frac{b}{1-c} \bigg)$$
		      as $(a,b,c) \in S$, we know that $c = 1 - \sqrt{1 - a^2 - b^2}$.

		      For the inverse, we procede the same way, solving the line equation for when $|l(t) - (0,0,1)| = 1$.
		      This time it is given by:
		      $$l(t) = (0,0,1) + t\cdot ((x,y,0) - (0,0,1))$$
		      So, for $|l(t) - (0,0,1)| = 1$ to happen, we must have:
		      $$t^2x^2 +t^2y^2 +t^2 = 1 \iff t^2(x^2 + y^2 + 1) = 1$$
		      yielding $t = \pm 1/\sqrt{x^2 + y^2  +1}$, as we know our solution is in the lower hemisphere, we have
		      $t = 1/\sqrt{x^2 + y^2  +1}$. Substituting back on the line equation we find
		      $$(a,b,c) = \bigg(\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + 1}}, \frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + 1}}, 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + 1}}\bigg)$$
	      \end{proof}
	\item \begin{proof}
		      $h^{-1} = f^{-1} \circ g^{-1}$, $g^{-1}$ was found in the previous item, and $f^{-1}$ is simply the projection
		      to the $xy$ plane. So
		      $$h^{-1}(u,v) = \bigg(\frac{u}{\sqrt{1 + u^2 + v^2}}, \frac{v}{\sqrt{1 + u^2 + v^2}} \bigg)$$
		      which is $C^\infty$. $h$ is a diffeomorphism.
	      \end{proof}

	\item \begin{proof}
		      This is the most interesting item, but we do exactly the same thing looking at the $S^n$ dimensional sphere in $R^{n+1}$.
		      Consider the stereographic projection $g: S \to \R^n$ from $(0,0,1)$ given by:
		      $$g(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n, x_{n+1}) = \bigg(\frac{x_1}{1 - c}, \dots, \frac{x_{n}}{1-c}, 1 - \frac{1}{1 - c}\bigg)$$
		      where $c = 1 - \bigg(\sum_{1}^{n} (x_i)^2\bigg)^{1/2}$
		      Then, following the same construction as before, we find $h$ and $h^{-1}$ where:
		      $$h(x_1,x_2 \dots, x_n) = \bigg(\frac{x_i}{1 - c} \bigg)_{i=1}^{n}$$
		      where the expression on the right is a vector. Similarly, $h^{-1}$ is defined as:
		      $$h^{-1}(x_1,x_2 \dots, x_n) = \Bigg(\frac{x_i}{\sqrt{1 + (x_1)^2 \dots + (x_n)^2}} \Bigg)_{i=1}^{n}$$
	      \end{proof}
